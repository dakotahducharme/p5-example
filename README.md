# p5-example
first crack at p5!

P5 is a javascript library used to create and process graphics. This is just a small example that I'm testing out, based off some examples of a book I've been reading. Enjoy!

When I'm done with the project, it will be pushed here: https://dakotahducharme.github.io/p5-example/
